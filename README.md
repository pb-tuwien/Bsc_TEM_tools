# SurveyTEM Package

## Overview

The `SurveyTEM` package is designed for processing and analyzing Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) survey data. It provides functionalities for reading, preprocessing, filtering, inverting, and visualizing TEM data.

## Features

- **Data Reading**: Read raw TEM data from files.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Add coordinates, normalize data, and calculate apparent resistivity and conductivity.
- **Data Filtering**: Filter data based on time range and noise floor.
- **Data Inversion**: Perform inversion to obtain subsurface resistivity models.
- **Data Forward Modeling**: Generate forward models for TEM data.
- **Visualization**: Plot raw, filtered, and inverted data.

## Installation

To install the package, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
